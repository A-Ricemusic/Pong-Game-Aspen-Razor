## About the Game
**Pong** is one of the earliest video games, and this one-player remake channels its nostalgic charm with a simple, interactive interface. Instead of competing against another paddle, it’s you versus the ball—aim for the highest score and hone your reflexes!

### Objective
- **Score Points**: Keep the ball in play by hitting it with the paddle. Each hit increases your score.
- **Avoid Resets**: If the ball slips past your paddle, your score resets to zero and the game restarts.

## Features
- **Single-Player Fun**: No opponents needed—just focus on your timing.
- **Real-Time Scoring**: Watch your points climb with every successful hit.
- **Instant Reset**: Miss the ball, and the game restarts automatically.
- **Simple Controls**: Use arrow keys or WASD for intuitive paddle movement.
- **Responsive UI**: Enjoy a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile browsers.
