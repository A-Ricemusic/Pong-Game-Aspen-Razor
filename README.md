## About the Game
**Pong** is one of the earliest video games, and this one-player remake channels the nostalgic charm with a simple, interactive interface. Instead of competing against another paddle, it’s just you versus the ball—aim for a high score and sharpen your reflexes!

### Objective
- **Score Points**: Keep the ball in play by hitting it with the paddle. Each hit increases your score.
- **Avoid Resets**: If the ball slips past your paddle, the score resets to zero, and the challenge begins anew.

## Features
- **Single-Player Fun**: No opponents needed—just focus on your timing and precision.
- **Real-Time Scoring**: Keep track of your points as you play.
- **Instant Reset**: Miss the ball, and the game restarts automatically.
- **Simple Controls**: Move the paddle using keyboard arrow keys or WASD for smooth, intuitive gameplay.
- **Responsive UI**: Enjoy the game seamlessly on both desktop and mobile browsers.
